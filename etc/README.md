# Bunch of different documents

We attempt to have both sources and pdf's. Gitlab displays pdf's right in the browser for seamless browsing.


## 3NWeb

 - [Overview and architecture](./3NWeb-overview.pdf) is a form to express architectural rationale, as a preamble for specs.


## IEEE

 - [January 2022 meeting presentation](./2022-01-05_ieee_meeting_notes.pdf) outlines 3NWeb parts, and gives a perspective for other related 3NWeb standards that together give a base to build useful stuff.
