# üóÉÔ∏è Various Documents

We strive to provide both source files and documents such as PDFs in `git` to keep track of our progress on 3NWeb and the active [PrivacySafe](https://privacysafe.app) implementation of these technical specifications.

## 3NWeb

- The [Overview and Architecture](3NWeb-overview.pdf) document serves as an introduction to the architectural rationale, providing context before diving into the technical specifications.

## IEEE

- The [January 2022 meeting presentation](2022-01-05_ieee_meeting_notes.pdf) outlines key aspects of 3NWeb, offering insights into related 3NWeb standards that together create a foundation for building practical applications.
